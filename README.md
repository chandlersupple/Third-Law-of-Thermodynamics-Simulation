# Third Law of Thermodynamics Simulation
A simulation representative of the Third Law of Thermodynamics - entropy of a 'perfect' crystalline structure

Controls:
The temperature of the system, as indicated in the upper right, can be controlled via the position of the cursor relative to the x-axis. Moving the cursor right will result in a higher temperature, and vice versa.

Running:
As the code was developed in Python 3.5, operating in a Python 3.5 environment will be most fitting. The code should work in Python 2.7 though to the best of my knowledge. Run the code in a Jupyter Notebook or 'repl.it' online if you don't have a suitable IDE or environment. The software will not run on a Chromebook, as it requires a desktop of which can be accessed.

* If you're interested, I'd be more than willing to provide a server based implementation of the code upon request (allowing Chromebook access). Email me at 'mischiefcity2013@gmail.com' (spam email).
